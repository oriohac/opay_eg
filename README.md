# opay_eg

Reproducing one of the best mobile banking app interface at record time.

## Getting Started

This project is based on reproducing the design of the Opay app. This project is not intended to  deceive people into thinking that it is related or functions in any way as the Opay Nigeria Mobile banking application, but helps new developers who may need little inspiration to practice their art.

The project is purely for practice purpose.
